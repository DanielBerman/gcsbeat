################### Gcpstoragebeat Configuration Example #########################

############################# Gcpstoragebeat ######################################

gcsbeat:
  # The number of seconds between looking for new files in your bucket.
  interval: 60s

  # The bucket containing your log files. If the `bucket_id` begins with file:// then the directory
  # pointed to will be used instead. This can be useful for testing your glob logic before
  # going live.
  bucket_id: my_log_bucket

  # The path to the key to authenticate your user to the bucket.
  # this service user _should_ have the `storage.objects.update`
  # permission so it can create metadata on the object preventing
  # it from being scanned multiple times.
  json_key_file: /path/to/key.json

  # Should the log file be deleted after its contents have been updated?
  delete: false

  # A glob pattern to filter files. Only files with names matching this will be considered.
  file_matches: "*.log"

  # Any files matching this glob are excluded from processing.
  file_exclude: "bak_*"

  # This key will be set on the objects after they've been processed by the beat. That way you can
  # stop the beat and not upload files again or prevent them from being uploaded by setting the
  # field manually.
  #
  # NOTE the key is a flag, if a file was partially processed some events will be resent.
  metadata_key: x-goog-meta-gcsbeat
